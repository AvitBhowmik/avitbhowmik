Humanity today is facing a multitude of challenges, climate change, biodiversity loss and geopolitical conflicts are a few to mention. If you are wondering how on earth we could imagine a sustainable society without addressing and rethinking our economic models, here is a revolutionary [â€œNot-for-Profit"](https://www.relationship-to-profit.net) economic model that may give you hope.

It's my pleasure to welcome the author of this model [Jennifer Hinton](https://www.relationship-to-profit.net/about-the-author) to Karlstad University for an exciting seminar jointly organised by Centre for Research on Sustainable Societal Transformation (CRS) and Klimatstudenterna - Karlstad Universitet. Not to mention that Jennifer is the author of the Not-for-Profit model and the book ["How on Earth"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01398.pdf), and has recently appeared at the front cover of "Grus & Guld". Listen to our conversation and the vibrant discussion with the audience [here](https://fb.watch/eiNF-MOMmO/).
