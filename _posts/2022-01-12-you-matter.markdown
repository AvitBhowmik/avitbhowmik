I have just received my signed copy of Karen O'Brien's brand new book ["You Matter More than You think"](https://www.youmattermorethanyouthink.com). The book includes the findings of my research on [Powers of 10](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9ed0) work and how we can harness the power of individuals entangled in fractals of communities. Impressive illustrations by Tone Bjordam. This is a must read if you are wondering how you can contribute to the transformation around climate change. Please purchase and support the sustainable publication and dissemination process this book has adopted.
