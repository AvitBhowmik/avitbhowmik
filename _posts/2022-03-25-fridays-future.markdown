Climate Students network at Karlstad University together with the Fridays for Future network at Karlstad organized the Global Climate Strike on 25 March 2022 at Stora Torget, Karlstad.

Human pressure on Earth is increasing to an unprecedented extend, irreversible tipping points are approaching, and time-windows for action are closing. Climate change will impact all of us and exacerbate existing inequalities.

But most importantly, there is HOPE and WE CAN STILL FIX IT! It is not too late: we need to exponentially increase climate action in politics, society and individuals, drive change, and show that a liveable and just future is not only needed, but also possible. I will share my story of climate hope this Friday.

A first step is joining thousands of people worldwide on Fridays and make your voices hard to make a difference.
