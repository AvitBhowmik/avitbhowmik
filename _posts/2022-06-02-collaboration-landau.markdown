[Centre for Sustainable Societal Transformation (CRS)](https://www.kau.se/en/crs) at Karlstad University is about to start new collaboration with the [Institute for Environmental Sciences (IES)](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en/campus-landau/faculty7/environmental-sciences) at University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany. I, as the Research Director and a representative of CRS, visited IES between 2-3 June 2022, to present research and activities of CRS and discuss potential research and personal exchange. The visit started with a seminar entitled "Climate Change: From a crisis to solutions", followed by a presentation of CRS and research activities. This presentation led to the discussion about possible joint research projects. Several common research interests emerged such as "Transformation of Agricultural Practices and Food Production" and "Social Innovation and Smart Specialization". Exchange of researchers via DAAD and DFG programs as well as exchange of  undergraduate students via EARSMUS and ERASMUS+ programs were also discussed. The visit ended by an observation of the IES research labs and activities.
