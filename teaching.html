<p>
I have joined as an Assistant Professor of Risk and Environmental Studies at Karlstad University in March 2019. But my teaching career started long before in Germany in 2012, when I joined University of Münster as an academic tutor. I mostly teach Climate Change and Sustainability, Environmental Risks and Geographic Information Systems and related courses. Since 2012, I have delivered more than 100 lectures and seminars at four German and Swedish universities. I have already obtained formal pedagogical and supervision training for higher education from the “Higher Education Teaching Centre” of University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany in 2013 and "Centre for Teaching and Learning" of Karlstad University, Sweden in 2021. I am the director of three courses at Karlstad University under the Risk and Environmental Studies Program. Meanwhile, I have also completed the supervision of 10 master’s and bachelor's, and two Ph.D. theses, and currently supervising a bachelor's and a Ph.D. theses.
