<p>I am trained as an environmental scientist specialized in Spatiotemporal Science (GIS and Geostatistics). However, I took a leap to be truly interdisciplinary and have been collaborating with several Social Science domains, such as Sustainability Science, Social Transformation Studies and backcasting and spatially explicit modelling.</p>

<p>My current research focuses on leverage points for rapid climate mitigation and sustainability transformation. I explore innovative and existing climate solutions, and study how they could be implemented to exponentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and abruptly transform societies to sustainability. I also explore and model scenarios for the successful implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goals. I led research on these topics at <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org" target="_blank">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a> and Earth-Doc network of the <a href="https://the-earth-league.org" target="_blank">Earth League</a> with Johan Rockström, <a href="https://futureearth.org" target="_blank">Future Earth</a> and <a href="https://previous.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/TransitionstoNewTechnologies/170403-TWI2050.html" target="_blank">The World in 2050</a> project of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.</p>


<p>I have published 24 research articles so far, including a leading article about social tipping points in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and many in the top 5\% of journals in the Web of Science category “Environmental Sciences” (1249 citations, h-index: 18 and i10-index: 24). Besides, I have contributed to several books and book chapters, high level reports and conference proceedings. I am an author of the <a href="https://exponentialroadmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Exponential-Climate-Action-Roadmap-September-2018.pdf" target="_blank">first Exponential Climate Action Roadmap Report</a> released in the Global Climate Action Summit 2018, and <a href="https://www.unsdsn.org/news/2018/07/13/twi2050-report-transformations-to-achieve-the-sustainable-development-goals" target="_blank">first World in 2050 Report</a> released in the UN High Level Political Forum in 2018. Access my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?pli=1&authuser=1&user=laRo5pgAAAAJ" target="_blank">full list of publications via Google Scholar</a>.</p>


<p>I am also serving as an ad-hoc reviewer for many highly-ranked interdisciplinary journals, e.g. Nature, Global Ecology and Biogeography, and International Journal of Climatology.</p>
