<p>I am trained as an environmental scientist with the core expertise in Spatiotemporal Science (GIS and Geostatistics). My current research focuses on disruptive sustainability transformation in the face of climate change and its geographic dynamics, and spatiotemporal resilience assessment from exposure to chemical contaminants in data-scarce developing countries. My research is inherently interdisciplinary and at the interface of natural and social sciences. I apply spatiotemporally explicit modelling tools in my research and also extensively work with policy and decision makers and science communicators.</p>

<p>My current research focuses on leverage points for rapid climate mitigation and sustainability transformation. I explore innovative and existing climate solutions, and study how they could be implemented to exponentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and abruptly transform societies to sustainability. I also explore and model scenarios for the successful implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goals. Previously, I led research on these topics at <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org" target="_blank">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a> and Earth-Doc network of the <a href="https://the-earth-league.org" target="_blank">Earth League</a> with Johan Rockström, <a href="https://futureearth.org" target="_blank">Future Earth</a> and <a href="https://previous.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/TransitionstoNewTechnologies/170403-TWI2050.html" target="_blank">The World in 2050</a> project of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.</p>


<p>My research activities are spanned over several interdisciplinary and application domains, e.g. rapid sustainability transformation, social tipping points, backcasting and spatially explicit modelling. Aiming to excel in the field, I have published 23 research articles including a leading article about social tipping points in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and many in the top 5\% of journals in the Web of Science category “Environmental Sciences” (h-index: 18). I am also serving as an ad-hoc reviewer for many highly-ranked interdisciplinary journals, e.g. Nature, Global Ecology and Biogeography, and International Journal of Climatology.</p>

<p>My current research focuses on social tipping points for climate mitigation and sustainability transformation. I explore innovative and existing climate solutions, and study how they could be implemented to exponentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and abruptly transform societies to sustainability. I also models the successful implementation pathways for UN Sustainable Development Goals. I am an author of the first Exponential Climate Action Roadmap Report released in the Global Climate Action Summit 2018. I am also an author of the first World in 2050 Report released in the UN High Level Political Forum in 2018. </p>
